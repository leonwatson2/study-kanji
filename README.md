It's an application to help me continue my kanji studies.

Inspiration comes from <a href="http://studykanji.net/kanjiquiz/" target="_blank">Study Kanji</a> which wasn't response. So I couldn't use it on the go.
I couldn't find the orignal creator of it to help so I decided to make my own.

## TODO

- [x] Save scores and show in select menu
- [x] Fix jisho link for kana
- [] Make a replay button on showing score
- [] Show full card on hold of mini card
- [] Show list of kanji on hold of Select group
